          I specialize in Rust systems programming and AI infrastructure. Currently building
          production AI systems while creating open source tools like Sealbox and Kira. I believe in
          software that's reliable, performant, and lets you sleep well at night.

          Outside of code, I practice bass and capture moments through photographyâ€”both teach me
          about rhythm, timing, and finding beauty in structure.
