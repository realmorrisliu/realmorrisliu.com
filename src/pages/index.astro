        <p>
          I specialize in Rust systems programming and AI infrastructure. Over 7 years, I've scaled
          from individual contributor to CTO, led engineering teams of 20+ people, and built
          enterprise platforms serving production workloads with 99.9%+ uptime.

          My open source projects include <Link href="https://github.com/realmorrisliu/sealbox"
            >Sealbox</Link
          > (zero-trust secret management) and my AI-native knowledge management system Kira (in early
          development). I've reduced infrastructure costs by 80% while improving system reliability at
          scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          I share deep technical insights in my

          infrastructure, and startup engineering. Learn more about my professional journey and

          Outside of code, I practice bass and capture moments through <Link href="/captured"
