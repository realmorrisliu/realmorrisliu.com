# Why I Built Sealbox

Building something meaningful requires understanding a problem deeply. When I started working on Sealbox, I wasn't just solving a technical challenge—I was addressing a fundamental friction in how developers work with data and systems.

## The Problem

Too many tools, too many interfaces, too much cognitive overhead. Modern development environments are cluttered with complexity that doesn't serve the core purpose: building and shipping great software.

## The Solution

Sealbox strips away the unnecessary and focuses on what matters. It's built around three core principles:

1. **Simplicity first**: Every feature must justify its existence
2. **Developer focus**: The tool should disappear, letting you focus on the work
3. **Intentional constraints**: Limitations that guide better decisions

## What I Learned

Building Sealbox taught me that the most difficult part of product development isn't adding features—it's knowing what to leave out. Every "helpful" addition makes the tool less helpful overall.

The best tools are invisible. They solve the problem without creating new ones.

## Moving Forward

Sealbox continues to evolve, but always with the same constraint: less, but better. Each new feature must prove it belongs, not just that it could be useful.

Sometimes the most valuable thing you can build is something that gets out of the way.
