# This is a Draft Post

This post is marked as `draft: true` in the frontmatter, so it won't appear on the public site.

This is useful for:

- Work-in-progress posts
- Ideas you're developing
- Content that needs review

When you're ready to publish, just change `draft: true` to `draft: false` (or remove the line entirely).
