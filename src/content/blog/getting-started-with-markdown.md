# Getting Started with Markdown

This is a demonstration post showing how the blog system handles various Markdown features. It's a great place to test formatting and see how content renders.

## Basic Formatting

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* naturally. `Inline code` works as expected, and you can create [links](https://example.com) easily.

## Lists

Unordered lists work well:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with more detail

Ordered lists too:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Code Blocks

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Quotes

## Creating Your Own Posts

To create a new blog post:

1. Add a new `.md` file to `src/content/blog/`
2. Include the required frontmatter fields
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The post will automatically appear in the Thoughts section

## Frontmatter Options

- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A brief summary
- `pubDate`: Publication date
- `updatedDate`: Optional update date
- `tags`: Array of tags
- `draft`: Set to `true` to hide from the site

That's it! The system handles the rest automatically.
