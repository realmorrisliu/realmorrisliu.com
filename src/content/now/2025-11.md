## Life Rhythm

I'm still keeping up with the early mornings, but I've adjusted my routine a bit. Instead of cooking breakfast early, I now **come home for lunch and cook then**. I often don't feel hungry for breakfast anyway, so I skip it sometimes. This rhythm feels more sustainable given how intense work has been.

## Work Milestones & Reflections

This month has been incredibly busy. We **completed the MVP for our B2B Sales Agent** and it's now with our first batch of beta users. To be honest, the results aren't great yet—performance is underwhelming and costs are high. There's still a lot of iteration ahead.

There's also some tension around product direction. I have disagreements with our product manager about the product's shape. I feel my approach might be more on-target, but then again, maybe I don't understand users as well as I think—this uncertainty sometimes makes me question my own judgment.

## Personal Project Exploration

**Gemini 3 Pro's release** was a turning point for me. It finally gave me the capability to start building **Kira** during my spare time. I'm starting with scheduling and ideas management. The UI and UX design are taking shape, but the Agent component still has issues—I can't fully use it yet and need to spend more time debugging. The plan is to dogfood it in my own work first, then share it with friends once the iteration loop feels smooth.

I've also been thinking about a new concept: an **education tutoring IDE** that helps students create personalized learning plans and tracking systems on top of standardized school curricula, grounded in **mastery-based learning** principles. It's still just an early-stage idea.

**Sealbox** is temporarily on hold due to bandwidth constraints.

## Recent Thoughts

I've been feeling some anxiety lately. There's this nagging worry that this is it—that I won't be able to build something that truly **makes the world a better place**. I feel a bit under pressure psychologically, questioning what constitutes truly meaningful work and what kind of products can genuinely help people.

Maybe this anxiety is part of the growth process. Keep moving forward. Keep trying.
