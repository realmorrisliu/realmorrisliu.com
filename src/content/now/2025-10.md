## Life Changes

On **October 3rd**, we officially moved into our new home—my wife picked the date, saying it's auspicious. The timing couldn't be better. Life has become noticeably healthier since then: I wake up at **7 AM** every morning for breakfast, then prep lunch. Cooking for ourselves just feels healthier, and I'm already noticing what feels like a positive trend in my weight.

I've also been exploring the idea of **biking to work**. It's theoretically feasible and would be great exercise. The weather is still a bit hot though, so I'm planning to start once it cools down a bit.

## Work & Technical Focus

Work has been intense lately. My new company is doing great work, but the pace is demanding. We're building a **B2B Sales Agent** that can autonomously source prospects, initiate conversations, and close deals. I've settled on a **FastAPI + Tanstack Start** architecture combination and set up a **monorepo** for the project.

During the setup process, I've been experimenting with some new tools—particularly **Flux CD**, which has been excellent. The whole experience of setting up proper GitOps workflows has been enlightening.

## Personal Projects Status

Given how busy work has been, **Kira** and **Sealbox** development has somewhat stalled. Right now I'm prioritizing the company project, but I'm not abandoning these personal projects—just putting them on hold while I navigate this intense phase at the new company.
