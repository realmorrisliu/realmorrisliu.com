## Life Rhythm

Yesterday was my birthday. I turned **31**.

I've been thinking about life in three phases: 1-30, 31-60, 61-90. The first phase is about learning and exploring. The second is about building and creating. The third is about reflecting and passing on. I'm now officially in phase two. It feels different—there's a quiet pressure to make these years count.

Life has been stable otherwise, though there's been some **drama in my residential community** lately. Some bad actors stirring things up. It's annoying but manageable.

## Work Milestones & Reflections

Our vision has evolved. We're no longer just building a B2B Sales Agent—we're working toward a **B2B Sales Network**, essentially a "better Google" for the B2B world. This requires high-quality, comprehensive data across industries globally, powered by AI and Agent technology.

My focus this month shifted heavily to **large-scale crawling architecture and data engineering**. I've been working on something innovative—fusing web crawling with modern data engineering practices, built on the **Medallion Architecture** (bronze/silver/gold data layers). It's not ready for open source yet, but I'm hoping to eventually package it into a reusable framework.

The work is technically demanding but intellectually satisfying. Building infrastructure at this scale forces you to think differently about data pipelines, quality, and reliability.

## Personal Project Exploration

I started learning **Godot** this month. The goal? Build a ridiculous fighting game called **Founders Fight Club**—imagine Silicon Valley founders beating each other up, with memes sprinkled throughout. Elon vs. Zuck? Sam vs. Jensen? Why not.

It's purely for fun and maybe some viral potential. I've always wanted to make indie games, and this feels like a good excuse to finally learn. Progress is slow—just basic scene setup so far—but it's a nice creative outlet.

**Kira** and the education IDE concept are still on hold. Not enough bandwidth.

## Recent Thoughts

The big news yesterday: **Meta acquired Manus**. The founder is my schoolmate. It hit me harder than I expected.

The anxiety from last month hasn't gone away. If anything, it's intensified. Seeing peers achieve major milestones makes me question my own pace. When will my startup reach a meaningful milestone? Am I building the right thing? Am I moving fast enough?

I don't have answers. But I keep reminding myself: comparison is the thief of joy, and everyone's timeline is different. The work continues.
