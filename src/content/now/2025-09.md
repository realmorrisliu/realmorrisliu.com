## Life Changes

We just finished a thorough whole-home cleaning, which immediately shifted the place from construction zone to livable. To keep formaldehyde in check before our target **October 1 move-in**, the fresh-air system and air purifiers are running nonstop. The kitchen is finally taking shape—fridge, stainless prep surface, sink + faucet, stovetop + range hood, and the gas water heater are installed. Tomorrow's agenda is the water purifier, dishwasher, and pre-filter. There's still some carpentry detail work outstanding, plus curtains and a few bathroom fixtures waiting in the queue, but the hope is to wrap everything in the coming stretch.

## Work & Technical Focus

I became **Head of Engineering at an early-stage startup** this month. We're a lean crew building an **AI Sales Agent** that can autonomously source prospects, initiate conversations, and broker deals—essentially an AI agent fused with CRM workflows. Right now my energy goes into wiring up reliable data ingestion, and documenting the frontend/backend architecture so execution stays aligned as we move fast.

Given the tight timeline, I'm evaluating a full-stack TypeScript approach to keep delivery velocity high while we prove the motion. It's a tradeoff between speed and longer-term flexibility, but the priority is getting a cohesive system in front of real users quickly.

## Personal Projects & Energy

Sealbox just received a full UI refresh so the experience finally matches the multi-client flow outlined in [this article](/thoughts/zero-trust-secret-management-design-decisions). Feature work is essentially complete, but the build is still in **active development** while I schedule deeper testing passes.

I also sprinted on **Kira**, pulling a one-day design session that distilled the product into two core ideas: *Thought Stream* for capturing ongoing thinking and *Co-think* for collaborative synthesis. I might write more about the interaction model soon. The next phase is building the first MVP, though I'm still debating the stack—Electron or Tauri keep bubbling to the top, and SwiftUI is tempting but outside my comfort zone. Claude Code couldn't quite realize the interface I pictured using SwiftUI, so the plan is to lean on familiar web tooling for the early iterations.
