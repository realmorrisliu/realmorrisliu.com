## The Missing Year-End Review

I kept telling myself I'd write a **2025 year-end review**. It never happened. January came and went, and now it's mid-February. The review is officially overdue, probably permanently.

The truth is, the past two months have been consumed by **Marco**. Not incremental improvements—a fundamental rethink of what we're building.

## Marco's Pivot: From Vertical to General

The biggest shift: moving away from building *yet another* vertical B2B agent (sourcing, sales, whatever). I became convinced that the ceiling for point solutions is too low, too fragmented.

Instead, I'm now building **Marco as a general-purpose Agent Runtime**—something closer to Codex or Pi in philosophy. The core insight is separating the *execution engine* from *business logic*:

- **Domain Pack Abstraction**: The same runtime core (session loop, tool loop, event streaming) can drive completely different behaviors through pluggable Domain Packs. Sourcing, Sales, Ops—they're just different packs on the same engine.

- **Skills System**: Business capabilities as hot-swappable skills, not hardcoded logic. The agent loads what it needs, when it needs it.

- **Multi-Agent Management**: AgentManager/AgentInstance patterns supporting concurrent specialized agents, each with isolated state and memory.

The technical foundation is solid—Rust's type system actually helps model these boundaries cleanly. But more importantly, it *feels* like the right layer to be building at. Less chasing feature parity with competitors, more creating infrastructure that could outlast the current wave of AI applications.

## Life Rhythm

Life has been stable. Same routine, same rhythm.

One new thing: some colleagues and I are planning to start a band called **MAJE**. Nothing serious, just something fun to balance the intensity of startup life. We'll see if it actually happens.

The work continues.
